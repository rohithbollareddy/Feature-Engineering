"In January 2019, Apple cut more than 200 employees from its self-driving car initiative, Project Titan, in what was internally described as a “restructuring.” Five months later, Apple confirmed that it had acquired Drive.ai, a self-driving startup that is backed by more than $77M in funding and was valued at $200M in 2017. The move is reported to be an “acqui-hire,” with Apple’s interests lying more with Drive.ai’s talent than its proprietary technology.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"For Apple, the move appears to be an effort to get its own autonomous vehicle efforts back on track. Project Titan has suffered setbacks since as early 2016, which marked the departure of project head Steve Zadesky and a rumored hiring freeze, as well as strategic uncertainty about the vision of the project.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In July 2016, Apple selected its legendary hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead its effort, in addition to hiring Dan Dodge, the founder and former CEO of QNX. The hires indicated a shift in strategy, with Project Titan reportedly deciding to prioritize the development of an autonomous driving system, while deprioritizing development of an electric vehicle.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In April 2017, new details seemed to confirm this pivot: Apple documents revealed the company was building an “automated system,” and the company hired robotics experts from NASA to boost its driverless efforts.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Apple spent 2018 building out the beginnings of its self-driving car fleet, with 70 vehicles officially on the road and registered with the California DMV as of September of that year. This reportedly made Apple the owner of the third-largest autonomous test vehicle fleet in the state, behind GM Cruise and Waymo. Apple’s test fleet logged a total of 80,739 miles of autonomous driving time from April 2017 through November 2018.

"In February 2020, self-driving software company Aptiv and ridesharing company Lyft reached a major milestone: the companies crossed 100,000 rides of its autonomous passenger service in Las Vegas. The company now services over 3,400 spots in Las Vegas, including popular locations such as the Los Angeles Convention Center and McCarren International Airport.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The program features a fleet of BMW 540s, retrofitted with Aptiv’s autonomous tech but with a safety driver present in the car. Reception to the program has been positive: Lyft reports that 98% of the passengers who took the rides gave the service a 5-star rating.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The Lyft partnership is just one of several programs that Aptiv has underway with its self-driving software. The company currently has autonomous driving operations in 4 markets: Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, and Singapore. In spring 2019, the company announced it was adding a fifth city, Shanghai.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The expansion into China is a major strategic move for Aptiv. China is expected to account for more than two-thirds of autonomous miles driven worldwide by 2040, according to McKinsey.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
Aptiv’s President of Autonomous Mobility Karl Iagnemma said:,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"“The long-term opportunity in China is off the charts… For Aptiv, it’s always been a question of not ‘if’ but ‘when’ we’re going to enter the Chinese market.”",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"These initiatives have translated into strong financial results for Aptiv. Over the course of 2019, the company’s stock posted gains of more than 50%. Stock performance was impressive in 2020 as well, with per share price reaching around $123 in December 2020.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Another major Aptiv initiative is Motional, its autonomous driving venture with Hyundai. The venture was officially unveiled in August 2020. Motional aims to build and commercialize SAE Level 4 vehicles (autonomous vehicles that can perform all driving functions), and make this technology available for robotaxi fleets in 2022. To make these plans a reality, Motional plans to increase its staff count to over 1,000 people in 2020. Karl Iagnemma, Motional’s president, says that his team “will have a car that can drive itself in defined areas ready for external testing by 2022.” In late November, the venture received approval from the state of Nevada to test its vehicles on public roads without safety drivers.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The last few years have witnessed a number of transformations at Aptiv. In May 2017, the company, then known as Delphi Automotive, spun off of its powertrain segment and rebranded itself as a new company: Delphi Technologies. A few months later, that company was renamed Aptiv. The rebrand was intended to focus the company’s software, electrical components, and other work on autonomous vehicles.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In October 2017, Delphi acquired autonomous software development shop nuTonomy, Inc. for $400M upfront. The goal of the acquisition was to get more than 60 Aptiv-branded autonomous cars onto public roads by the end of the year. The acquired startup had a strong track record: in 2016, nuTonomy integrated self-driving car technology into a ride-hailing service for the very first time in Singapore. It then also became the first to test such technology on public streets in Boston, Massachusetts. In April 2018 (after the acquisition), nuTonomy was officially named a finalist for Fast Company’s 2018 World Changing Ideas Awards.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The company has also partnered with Quanergy Systems to develop and deploy solid-state lidar, which could dramatically lower the cost of these systems.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars

Audi has made big promises about its plans for autonomous and electric vehicles. The German brand has said it plans to spend close to $16B on self-driving and sustainable tech by 2023.,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Those efforts were primarily being undertaken by Autonomous Intelligent Driving (AID), Audi’s self-driving technology outfit, first launched in 2017. The operation, which is based in Munich and boasts more than 200 employees, had 12 autonomous vehicles on public roads in its home city in 2018.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Audi chief technology officer Alexandre Haag has compared AID to GM’s self-driving unit, Cruise, and Ford’s unit, Argo. But Haag is pragmatic about the realities of getting autonomous fleets deployed, given how much rests on the dependability — and safety — of the technology. He said:",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"“Getting to 90 percent [in perception] is fairly easy. Getting to 95 percent starts to get interesting. And then you still need to go way beyond that. Nine point nine nine nine nine… Adding each nine is ten times harder. When you’re at 95 percent, you’ve just scratched the surface.”",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Audi formed new technology partnerships in an effort to expedite its autonomous timelines. In December 2018, the company announced that AID would partner with Luminar, a Silicon Valley manufacturer of lidar sensors and perception software that also works with Volvo and Toyota. But in June 2020, AID was acquired by the US-based startup Argo AI — jointly owned by Ford and Audi’s parent Volkswagen — and became its European headquarters and fifth engineering center.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
Audi is also part of the German consortium — which includes Daimler and BMW — that bought Nokia’s HERE precision mapping assets for $3.1B. HERE has made strides in designing an open specification for vehicle sensor data collected and transmitted to the cloud by connected vehicles.,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Audi has revealed several autonomous vehicle prototypes derived from its A7 and RS 7 models, including consumer-oriented test vehicles.

In April 2017, Audi hired former Tesla Autopilot program manager Alexandre Haag as the unit’s CTO. In June 2020, he was appointed the head of technology for Argo AI’s Munich office.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Audi plans to commercialize its technology in its next-generation A8 flagship, although the vehicle’s SAE Level 3 automation will have limited availability, pending regulatory approval. The luxury brand operates under the umbrella of the Volkswagen Group, so developments within the division could have broader implications going forward, as evident in the case of AID and Argo AI.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"While a fully autonomous fleet may still be a ways away for Audi, the company has been among the most aggressive at introducing semi-autonomous options to the market.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In July 2017, Audi unveiled its new flagship A8, which has a controversial autonomous driving feature that lets drivers fully take their hands off the wheel while the car drives up to 37 mph. At the time, it was the first vehicle in production that could actually allow its users to “drive” hands-free.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The 2019 A8 model includes an enhanced suite of semi-autonomous features, including adaptive cruise control and collision mitigation capabilities, as well as improved object recognition.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The Audi A8 with the full complement of self-driving features has only been initially approved for release and made street-legal in Europe. But the company seems to be taking a step back: its A8 sedan won’t be equipped with the Level 3 partial automation system, called Traffic Jam Pilot, due to safety concerns and the lack of a legal framework.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars

"As AVs are gradually deployed in the decades ahead, they will share the road with conventional vehicles and fallible human drivers. The promise of safer roads enabled by self-driving tech will take time to materialize. Carmakers are developing various safety solutions to account for inevitable crashes.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Autoliv, the world’s largest automotive safety supplier, is at the forefront of these efforts. The company is trying to reimagine the future of airbags and prevent human errors from turning into catastrophes. For example, drivers of autonomous vehicles may be able to swivel in their chairs, lower seats into beds, or turn around to talk to other passengers. In the event of an accident, typical seatbelts and airbags would be of little use.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
Autoliv is developing an airbag that resembles a protective cocoon and is integrated into the seat frame. It would protect drivers from loose items or unbuckled backseat passengers. Autoliv showcased a prototype in January 2019 at the AutoMobili-D exhibition in Detroit.,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The company was also working with Volvo on creating self-driving software. In 2017, the duo established a new joint partnership called Zenuity that uses Nvidia’s AI technologies for software development. Three years later, Zenuity was split in two. Volvo took over the autonomous driving division, while Autoliv’s spinoff Veoneer will continue work on advanced driver assistance software.

"Baidu first began testing its open-source Apollo software system on the open road in 2017. In 2018, the company received approval from the Chinese government to start testing Apollo on 33 different roads spanning 65 miles around Beijing. The Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport also granted Baidu its first batch of T4 test permits — the highest level of autonomous vehicle clearance currently available in China. The T4 permits let Baidu operate its vehicles in challenging urban environments, such as tunnels and school zones. In January 2019, Baidu unveiled Apollo Enterprise, a new line that will focus primarily on use cases including highway driving, valet parking, autonomous mini-buses, and mapping technology. These efforts have yielded impressive results.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"By December 2019, Baidu had 300 autonomous vehicles on the road and had logged over 3M kilometers (roughly 1.8M miles) of urban driving. The same month, Baidu received licenses to test its fleet of autonomous robot taxis in certain areas of Beijing. Nine months later, the company launched a robotaxi service in China’s capital. A fleet of 40 cars serves almost 100 pickup and drop-off stations, and rides can be summoned via Baidu’s e-hailing platform.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In August 2020, Baidu announced that its Apollo Computing Unit (ACU) was ready for use. The autonomous driving computer is capable of handling huge amounts of radar and camera data. It will power a valet parking service called Apollo Valet Parking, similar to Tesla’s Summon feature. ACU will initially be deployed in electric vehicles built by the China-based carmaker WM Motor.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Baidu has also entered a partnership with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to equip Geely cars with self-driving technology provided by Baidu, including Apollo’s DuerOS. Tesla partnered with Baidu in January 2020 to use its mapping data for its vehicles in China.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In April 2014, Baidu partnered with BMW to develop a semi-autonomous prototype. The partners tested their technologies on highways in China but parted ways in November 2016 following disagreements about strategy.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The search giant has also opened two Silicon Valley artificial intelligence research labs, although Andrew Ng (its chief AI scientist) departed the company in March 2017. Baidu also intends to spin off its self-driving unit once it matures (similar to Alphabet with Waymo).",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"For years, Apollo has been used by chipmakers and small startups to kickstart work in self-driving cars, but big corporates — including Nvidia, Bosch, Daimler, and Ford — have also found it useful.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
