"The term ‘autopilot’ has been used for decades within the aircraft industry, enabling pilots to reduce their cognitive load by allowing an aircraft to practically fly itself during “cruising” portions of the trip. The same is now happening as cars with autopilot are rapidly turning into more autonomous, self-driving vehicles, allowing drivers to let the cars drive themselves on certain portions of the trip, like freeways.",Autonomous Cars
"Tesla most famously branded its self-driving features as “Autopilot”, but many other automakers are now including similar self-driving and autonomous vehicle features as part of their driving assistance option packages. ",Autonomous Cars
"This article provides a breakdown of cars with autopilot and who offers what, but first, we’ll go through a bit of background and explanation of terms.",Autonomous Cars
"First, let’s define exactly what constitutes ‘autopilot’-like features. Autonomous systems in cars and self-driving vehicles can take many different forms, from basic driver assistance features, like cruise control, to semi-autonomous, all the way to full self-driving capabilities. The industry even has a set of levels to help classify this automation.",Autonomous Cars
Learn more about this by reading our article on SAE self-driving levels for cars and autonomous vehicles.,Autonomous Cars
"Autopilot is a generic term used in multiple industries, particularly aircraft, and generally means that something can guide itself without human intervention.  In relation to cars in 2021, most mainstream carmakers are focused on, Level 2 autonomy. This level allows the vehicle to take over most steering, acceleration and braking functions, but still requires that the driver remain fully attentive to the driving situation and be able to intervene at any moment. It is not driverless, fully autonomous driving, like robotaxis from Waymo or Cruise (that are now testing in California).",Autonomous Cars
"That means, today, autopilot really means ‘assisted driving’ and not ‘self-driving’ since the driver still has to be alert and attentive at all times.  It won’t be until Level 4 or Level 5 fully autonomous cars hit the roads that the true promise of full self-driving will be a reality. Currently, that’s not expected to happen until 2022 (although the team at Tesla is pushing hard to do so as soon as possible, as announced at Tesla Autonomy Day, since all new cars sold with Hardware 3 are much more powerful).",Autonomous Cars

Core AutoPilot Features,Autonomous Cars
"At minimum, we define autopilot (Level 2) to include the following features for use on freeways and highways with “controlled access” (i.e., they have on-ramps and off-ramps and no-cross traffic intersections):",Autonomous Cars
"Other autopilot features that are useful, but not critical for the ‘autopilot’ designation, are:",Autonomous Cars
Presently only Tesla is able to achieve the additional three mentioned above with their Full Self-Driving and Enhanced Autopilot options on ‘Hardware 2’ vehicles.,Autonomous Cars
Isn’t This Just Automated Cruise Control with Lane Centering?,Autonomous Cars
"If you step back and look at the core of what’s being provided, we’re really talking about automated cruise control with the ability to steer itself (keep the vehicle centered in the lane).  However, the second part (steering) is critical and one of the most difficult tasks, which we’ll explain below.",Autonomous Cars
Lane Keeping Assist vs Automated Lane Centering (steering),Autonomous Cars
"One of the most confusing aspects of choosing a good autopilot system is understanding the difference between what’s often called “Lane Keeping Assist” (LKA) and automated steering where the system is actually keeping the car centered at all times with no driver input (other than hands on the wheel, if the system requires it). ",Autonomous Cars
"Almost all major car companies have some sort of LKA functionality, however, that usually means helping to move the vehicle back to the center of the lane if it drifts.  Some systems are robust enough where you could keep your hands off the wheel for a short period of time so it feels like automated steering to a certain degree.",Autonomous Cars
"In reality, the future systems will be ones that can accurately identify the road and combine that with map data to ensure the car can steer itself on the road as good or better than a human driver.  So far, only Tesla and GM’s Super Cruise are able to do that, but only in certain conditions (e.g. the road only has mild curves).",Autonomous Cars
"The bottom line is, if you see “Lane Keeping Assist”, be sure to dig into that feature and test drive it on the freeway to understand whether it automatically keeps the system centered in the lane automatically, and how well it does it.  The last thing you want is a false sense of security and have the car drift into another lane or off the road.",Autonomous Cars
What About Basic Safety Features?,Autonomous Cars
"Most all cars that have autopilot-like features, also have fairly common automated safety systems included, called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) within the industry. These core safety features include:",Autonomous Cars
All these features are “must-have” today and you should double check to ensure they are included with your vehicle and package options.,Autonomous Cars
"Historically, most auto-manufacturers have relied on Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), like Mobileye, Delphi and Bosch, etc. to provide autopilot parts and technologies for their cars, including things like navigation systems.  This allows the auto manufacturers to concentrate on developing and marketing the core cars themselves while other companies focus on specialized parts and technology.",Autonomous Cars
"Mobileye, which was purchased by Intel, is arguably the leading OEM in providing autopilot technology, via their EyeQ line of visual perception chips, to auto manufacturers. They famously provided Autopilot technology for the first-generation Tesla Model S vehicles that came with Enhanced Autopilot. Later, Tesla began to develop its own technology as Elon Musk wanted to push autonomous driving technology faster.  Mobileye previously focused on perception technology (i.e. identifying objects) with its EyeQ chips and it was up to the manufacturers to integrate driving control hardware and software but now Mobileye is also beginning to offer “full-stack” autopilot solutions.  Today Mobileye is providing autopilot-like technology to manufacturers such as Audi, BMW and Nissan via their EyeQ 4 and EyeQ 5 chipsets.  ",Autonomous Cars
"NVIDIA is close behind Mobileye in developing autopilot features.  In fact, their latest ADAS system is termed “Autopilot” (see this article).  NVIDIA comes from a gaming / AI chipset development background and rightfully believes that more powerful AI-like system will be required in cars to achieve reliable full-self driving.  They are supplying solutions to Volvo and Mercedes for their future vehicles.",Autonomous Cars
"Other startups and companies, like Cruise (GM), Aurora, Argo and Zoox (now Amazon) are also gaining momentum, but are primarily focused on robo-taxis and are in testing phases rather than large-scale rollouts.",Autonomous Cars
"That said, many car manufacturers are developing their own technology as they feel it’s critical as a future differentiator. Tesla is most famous in this regard, having created a sophisticated Autopilot system using a neural network based on cameras.  Toyota, Honda and Subaru have also created their own systems.  ",Autonomous Cars
"Why does it matter? Generally speaking, dedicated OEMs like Mobileye can innovate faster than auto manufacturers. However, some auto manufacturers like Tesla are innovating so quickly that they push over-the-air software updates to their cars, just like your smartphone. Most traditional auto manufacturers don’t update software, requiring you to purchase a new model year instead.",Autonomous Cars
"Regardless, all manufacturers are beholden to regulatory approval before bringing new autonomous driving technology to the market. ",Autonomous Cars
"For those automotive enthusiasts and tech-savvy tinkerers who want cutting-edge autopilot features, there is another solution from comma.ai using the open-source openpilot software.  This taps into newer-model vehicles with autopilot, like the ones below, but supercharges them with advanced machine learning and neural network capabilities.",Autonomous Cars
Learn more about the Comma.ai openpilot solution and even check out the openpilot vs Tesla Autopilot to see how they compare.,Autonomous Cars
"Most auto manufacturers claim to have some sort of self-driving capability, whether it’s basic Adaptive Cruise Control or Lane Keeping Assist, or a combination of both.  However, simply having those features doesn’t mean they work well. ",Autonomous Cars
These are generally the most important criteria for autopilot functionality:,Autonomous Cars
"While we have not personally tested each system, the criteria above are what we watch out for in reviews and videos to understand how well each autopilot system performs.",Autonomous Cars
"While there are many ‘autopilot’-like systems available from car manufacturers today, they are generally a combination of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA). As mentioned previously LKA by itself only nudges a car back to the center of the lane, but does not keep it centered.",Autonomous Cars
The cars below are ones that are generally considered the top cars with autopilot and do a good job automatically keeping a car centered in the lane.,Autonomous Cars
Top Cars with AutoPilot features for 2021:,Autonomous Cars
"We go into more detail on each one below, so read on.",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:Tesla has long been a leader in terms of autopilot functionality in cars, even calling their system ‘Autopilot’. Not only is their system one of the most sophisticated and accurate on the road, but it’s also continually updated over-the-air (just like your smartphone), so the vehicles just keep getting better and better. The biggest downside is that driver monitoring only uses steering wheel inputs to determine whether the driver is paying attention vs facial monitoring, for example.",Autonomous Cars
"What It’s Called:Autopilot and Full-Self Driving options. For more information, read our detailed review on Tesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. ",Autonomous Cars
"Technology Used:Tesla uses eight cameras around the vehicle for a full 360 view, plus a front-facing radar and long-range ultrasonic sensors. It uses a powerful machine learning computer (called the Full Self-Driving Computer, aka Hardware 3) which began rolling out in early 2019.",Autonomous Cars
"Supported Models: All current Tesla vehicles (the Tesla Model S, Model X and Model 3) all support Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features as an option, AP2 and above.  Older Tesla models (pre-2016) with AP1 have an older version of Autopilot that doesn’t have all the current features.",Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:The best of the best in terms of functionality, especially with the Full Self-Driving package that includes the ability to work on city streets and respond to traffic controls and has the Navigate-on-Autopilot feature, that automatically routes the vehicle on closed-access freeway systems (on-ramp to off-ramp).  Tesla continually updates Autopilot with powerful features rolling out all the time. However it’s so powerful it can be used almost anywhere, meaning it’s up to the driver to pay attention and use it properly as driver monitoring is only via the steering wheel.",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:General Motors is arguably one of the top innovators in self-driving technology, having launched its highly-regarded Super Cruise technology on the Cadillac CT6 and with its work on Cruise, a subdivision of GM, working on creating fully-self driving fleet vehicles (like taxis).  The new Chevy Bolt also has a more limited version of Super Cruise.",Autonomous Cars
What It’s Called:Super Cruise,Autonomous Cars
"Technology Used:Super Cruise packages a variety of technology from suppliers including Intel’s Mobileye platform, Trimble RTX for positioning, forward facing cameras, side cameras, radar plus an internal camera from FOVIO for eye tracking. ",Autonomous Cars
"Supported Models:Cadillac CT6, 2021 Cadillac Escalade, 2021 Chevy Bolt (limited version)",Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:The Super Cruise system at or right behind Tesla Autopilot in our opinion.  While Tesla Autopilot is more powerful and sophisticated, the Super Cruise system is better suited to everyday drivers since it restricts use to freeways it has mapped in the US (most major ones) and strictly monitors driver attentiveness using eye-tracking, therefore limiting mistakes that can be made by drivers, particularly older drivers (Cadillac’s primary demographic).  The driver monitoring system is one of the reasons why Consumer Reports gives it the highest rating, even about Tesla’s Autopilot system. ",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:The Volkswagen Group is the parent company of several brands, including VW, Audi, and Porsche. Audi has recently made aggressive moves into self-driving, including touting a Level 3 system in Europe which is unfortunately not yet in the US due to regulatory concerns. So, for now autopilot functions in Audi are similar to others.",Autonomous Cars
"What It’s Called:Active Lane Assist with Stop & Go (for higher speeds) and Traffic Jam Assist (for lower speeds).  The future, Level 3, version that will be hands-off in speeds under 37 MPH, will be called “Traffic Jam Pilot”. It’s currently available in some other countries, but not yet in the US.  There’s also a system called “Adaptive Drive Assist” for foreign markets.",Autonomous Cars
"Technology Used:Audi has recently made aggressive moves into self-driving, including the first Lidar unit in a consumer vehicle, the A8 (and now the A6 and Q8), in addition to its new zFAS controller that integrates sensor inputs into a single computing unit. They also work with Mobileye (EyeQ 4 chips) for perception inputs.",Autonomous Cars
"Supported Models: Audi A8, A6 and Q8",Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:While Audi has been aggressively diving into advanced autonomous technologies, it hasn’t yet translated into a usable product for the US that’s anything beyond what other companies currently offer.",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:BMW has long had adaptive cruise control with rudimentary lane center, but with certain 2019 models, they are rolling out new technology. The system is not updated over the air and must be taken into the dealer for updates.",Autonomous Cars
What It’s Called:Driving Assistant Pro with Extended Traffic Jam Assistant,Autonomous Cars
"Technology Used:BMW utilizes the Mobileye EyeQ platform in the Driving Assistant package with control software from ZF, and on the newest models, the EyeQ 4 chip with a tri-focal camera set looking forward. It also has forward and rear radar sensors.  With some options, it also includes an eye monitoring camera.",Autonomous Cars
"Supported Models: Available on select models, including BMW X5 7 and 3 series.",Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:The BMW system is loaded with features but its lane centering (crucial for autopilot), leaves something to be desired and isn’t nearly as robust as Tesla’s during our tests.  That said, at low speeds (under 40mph) in freeway traffic, the hands-free option (using eye-monitoring) is a nice option.",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:Ford offers basic driver assistance with many of its current vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, called Co-Pilot 360, which includes basic stop-and-go Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with basic Automatic Lane Centering (ALC) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA).  However, where things really get interesting will be with the upcoming Ford Co-Pilot 360 2.0, now called “BlueCruise” coming later in 2021 on the 2021 Mach-E and the 2021 Ford F-150.  This will include more advanced, Tesla-like Autopilot capabilities. ",Autonomous Cars
"What It’s Called:Co-Pilot 360 – today’s basic system with ACC, LC and LKA functions.Co-Pilot 360 Plus – Lincoln’s version upgraded slightly.Co-Pilot 360 2.0 (BlueCruise) – coming later in 2021 with optional Active Driver Assist that includes more sophisticated Autopilot-like features and requires a subscription.",Autonomous Cars
Technology Used:Ford has partnered with Mobileye and utilizes the Mobileye EyeQ technology components. ,Autonomous Cars
Supported Models:2020 vehicles like the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator that include the Co-Pilot 360 options have today’s basic driver assistance.  The newer Co-Pilot 360 2.0 with Active Driver Assist will be coming out later in 2021 on the Mach-E and Ford F-150 and will have more robust Tesla Autopilot-like features.,Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:Overall the Ford / Lincoln Co-Pilot 360 system as it stands today is a very capable Autopilot system. While the Lane Centering won’t handle sharp turns, it does a great job on primarily straight roads with gentle curves.  This system will definitely help with long commutes and freeway driving.  The next version, Co-Pilot 360 2.0 / “BlueCruise”, coming with the Mach-E and Ford F-150 later in 2021 should be one to watch.",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:The Hyundai Motor Group and Kia Motors are jointly owned entities that produce distinct but similar vehicles using common platforms and parts. In 2019 Hyundai invested in self-driving startup Aurora, but that technology has not made it to public release yet.  Currently, Kia and Hyundai offer Level 2 technology in some of their 2020 vehicles that is best-in-class outside of advanced systems like Tesla and GM Supercruise.",Autonomous Cars
"What It’s Called:Lane Following Assist (LFA) and  Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go (SCC)Highway Drive Assist (HDA) combines LFA and SCC, plus automatically adjust to speed limits",Autonomous Cars
"Technology Used:Currently Hyundai / Kia used an in-house technology called HDA2 (Highway Driving Assist), but may in the future leverage technology from the Aurora investment.  They also have worked with Intel / Mobileye in the past as well and likely use their EyeQ sensors.",Autonomous Cars
"Supported Models:Hyundai Palisade, Sonata, Kia Telluride, plus others.",Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:The Hyundai and Kia Level 2 driving-assist implementations are incredibly impressive and have gotten very positive reviews so far, with many people comparing it favorably to Tesla’s Autopilot, at least as far as basic adaptive cruise control and lane centering is concerned (although it can not handle sharp turns). For someone looking for a system to take the edge of the daily commute, it’s worth considering.",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:Volvo has always been a leader in safety technology and was one of the first companies to bring advanced safety systems and lane centering to its full lineup of vehicles. They recently have had some self-driving setbacks as they’ve decided to switch platforms, delaying more sophisticated autopilot-like features.",Autonomous Cars
What It’s Called:Pilot Assist (the latest version is technically Pilot Assist II)Future 2022 version will be called “Highway Assist”,Autonomous Cars
"Technology Used:Volvo currently leverages the Mobileye EyeQ 3 platform and has a front-facing camera and radar (Delphi’s RaCAM – Radar and Camera Sensor Fusion System, that sits on the windshield).  In the future with “Highway Assist” in 2022, they plan to switch from Mobileye to the NVIDIA Orin chipset and incorporate front-facing LiDAR as well with the help of Zenseact on the software side. ",Autonomous Cars
Supported Models: All Volvo models including XC90 / XC60 / XC40 and sedans.,Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:Volvo’s Pilot Assist II is only fair when it comes to autopilot quality. It’s helpful in straight stop-and-go traffic, but we wouldn’t trust the driving to Pilot Assist on roads with curves as it has challenges staying in the lanes.",Autonomous Cars
"Overview:Mercedes actually helped pioneer adaptive cruise control in the late 1990s with it’s high-end S-class sedan.  As a luxury car provider, Mercedes has continually ensured that it’s vehicles have the latest technology available, but has been a bit behind lately in advancing autopilot features.",Autonomous Cars
"What It’s Called:Driver Assistance Package PLUS package that includes options like Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC, Active Steering Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist and Active Lane Change Assist.",Autonomous Cars
Technology Used:Mercedes works with Bosch and NVIDIA to power its systems via a combination of camera and radar inputs.,Autonomous Cars
Supported Models: E-Class and S-Class sedans,Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:The Mercedes system does a fair job with autopilot functionality and nicely ties map data to the driving system, for example, helping to slow the vehicle around bends as needed.",Autonomous Cars
Overview:Nissan and Infiniti have come a long way in bringing practical safety and self-driving technology to the masses. It’s Nissan ProPilot is available on lower-end models such as the Nissan Rogue.,Autonomous Cars
What It’s Called:ProPilot Assist,Autonomous Cars
"Technology Used:Nissan / Infiniti use the Mobileye EyeQ platform, leveraging forward camera and radar inputs.",Autonomous Cars
Supported Models: Nissan Rogue and Nissan LEAFInfiniti QX50,Autonomous Cars
Core Features:,Autonomous Cars
"Verdict:Nissan and Infiniti’s ProPilot system does an admiral job brining basic autopilot features to the masses.  Automated lane centering is just fair.  Nissan announced ProPILOT 2.0 for Japan, which is much more advanced, but is unclear when it will come to the US at this point.",Autonomous Cars
"Toyota has the Toyota Safety Sense (TSS) system, the latest version being TSS 2.0.  Lexus calls its system the Lexus Safety System (LSS) and the automation Lexus CODRIVE.  TSS 2.0 initially became available in the 2020 RAV4 and 2020 Corolla and has since rolled out to more vehicles.  Both Lexus and Toyota use a feature called “Lane Tracing Assist” which allows the vehicle to center itself in a lane, but is not as robust as Tesla, Cadillac or BMW.",Autonomous Cars
"Honda has the Honda Sensing Suite that includes ACC and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS). With Acura it’s called AcuraWatch and also comes with LKAS.  As with the Toyota / Lexus system, it allows the vehicle to center itself in the lane but isn’t particularly sophisticated and requires constant vigilance.   ",Autonomous Cars
"Subaru has offered their Eyesight technology for quite some time that provides ACC and basic LKA.  It uses two cameras above the windshield for stereoscopic vision.  While this does a decent job, it isn’t as robust as other systems that use a combination of cameras and radar.",Autonomous Cars
"While not an auto manufacturer, Comma.ai has released a DIY autopilot kit based on the openpilot, called Comma Two.  It only works on certain, modern cars but is an interesting alternative for those tech-savvy car enthusiasts who want to hack their cars. Additionally, it won high praise from Consumer Reports in terms of overall capabilities and functions. ",Autonomous Cars
"Autopilot-like functions are becoming more and more mainstream as technology improves. By 2022, most car manufacturers will be offering some sort of more advanced self-driving capabilities.",Autonomous Cars
"However, for now, if you want the most powerful AutoPilot-like functionality, we’d opt for a Tesla or GM vehicle with Super Cruise.  That said, Ford has a great system with BlueCruise, Hyundai / Kia has a solid offering on their latest vehicles, Audi is coming on strong and BMW, Nissan/Infiniti, and others will continue to expand their Mobileye offerings over the next few years. All other systems are still fairly immature and require heavy attentiveness, but will be improving quickly in early 2021.",Autonomous Cars
What’s Important to Know When Evaluating,Autonomous Cars
"When evaluating autopilot-like self driving systems, the main thing to look out for is Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and whether it handles starting and stopping at all speeds and on what kinds of roads.  Then learn how well the vehicle can identify roads and stay in the center of the lane, called Lane Centering.  Most manufacturers tout “Lane Keeping Assist” (LKA) as a way to help automate steering, but that’s different from Lane Centering and often a far cry from something like Tesla’s Autopilot system or Cadillac’s Super Cruise that are able to stay steadily centered in the lanes while driving.",Autonomous Cars
"If you’re not sure, check out videos on YouTube – enthusiasts and professionals often test out the systems to provide their opinions and real-world examples.",Autonomous Cars
"Also, ask the dealer how the system can be updated since technology and software changes so quickly.  In Tesla’s case, the Autopilot system is continually updated over-the-air with software updates.  Most other auto manufacturers require the updates to occur at the dealer during regular service updates.",Autonomous Cars
"Either way, the good news is that more and more cars will have autopilot features and help cars become much safer in the years to come.",Autonomous Cars

"In January 2019, Apple cut more than 200 employees from its self-driving car initiative, Project Titan, in what was internally described as a “restructuring.” Five months later, Apple confirmed that it had acquired Drive.ai, a self-driving startup that is backed by more than $77M in funding and was valued at $200M in 2017. The move is reported to be an “acqui-hire,” with Apple’s interests lying more with Drive.ai’s talent than its proprietary technology.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"For Apple, the move appears to be an effort to get its own autonomous vehicle efforts back on track. Project Titan has suffered setbacks since as early 2016, which marked the departure of project head Steve Zadesky and a rumored hiring freeze, as well as strategic uncertainty about the vision of the project.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In July 2016, Apple selected its legendary hardware executive Bob Mansfield to lead its effort, in addition to hiring Dan Dodge, the founder and former CEO of QNX. The hires indicated a shift in strategy, with Project Titan reportedly deciding to prioritize the development of an autonomous driving system, while deprioritizing development of an electric vehicle.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In April 2017, new details seemed to confirm this pivot: Apple documents revealed the company was building an “automated system,” and the company hired robotics experts from NASA to boost its driverless efforts.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars

"The Lyft partnership is just one of several programs that Aptiv has underway with its self-driving software. The company currently has autonomous driving operations in 4 markets: Boston, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, and Singapore. In spring 2019, the company announced it was adding a fifth city, Shanghai.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The expansion into China is a major strategic move for Aptiv. China is expected to account for more than two-thirds of autonomous miles driven worldwide by 2040, according to McKinsey.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
Aptiv’s President of Autonomous Mobility Karl Iagnemma said:,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"“The long-term opportunity in China is off the charts… For Aptiv, it’s always been a question of not ‘if’ but ‘when’ we’re going to enter the Chinese market.”",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"These initiatives have translated into strong financial results for Aptiv. Over the course of 2019, the company’s stock posted gains of more than 50%. Stock performance was impressive in 2020 as well, with per share price reaching around $123 in December 2020.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Another major Aptiv initiative is Motional, its autonomous driving venture with Hyundai. The venture was officially unveiled in August 2020. Motional aims to build and commercialize SAE Level 4 vehicles (autonomous vehicles that can perform all driving functions), and make this technology available for robotaxi fleets in 2022. To make these plans a reality, Motional plans to increase its staff count to over 1,000 people in 2020. Karl Iagnemma, Motional’s president, says that his team “will have a car that can drive itself in defined areas ready for external testing by 2022.” In late November, the venture received approval from the state of Nevada to test its vehicles on public roads without safety drivers.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The last few years have witnessed a number of transformations at Aptiv. In May 2017, the company, then known as Delphi Automotive, spun off of its powertrain segment and rebranded itself as a new company: Delphi Technologies. A few months later, that company was renamed Aptiv. The rebrand was intended to focus the company’s software, electrical components, and other work on autonomous vehicles.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In October 2017, Delphi acquired autonomous software development shop nuTonomy, Inc. for $400M upfront. The goal of the acquisition was to get more than 60 Aptiv-branded autonomous cars onto public roads by the end of the year. The acquired startup had a strong track record: in 2016, nuTonomy integrated self-driving car technology into a ride-hailing service for the very first time in Singapore. It then also became the first to test such technology on public streets in Boston, Massachusetts. In April 2018 (after the acquisition), nuTonomy was officially named a finalist for Fast Company’s 2018 World Changing Ideas Awards.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars

"In the public eye, EV manufacturer Tesla became an early leading banner-carrier for advanced driver assistance and self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk has been particularly bullish on the field, announcing in 2015 that the technology behind fully autonomous vehicles was only “2 to 3 years away,” with another “1 to 5 years” needed for regulatory approvals.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Tesla pushed its Autopilot software update to properly equipped Model S vehicles in October 2015, enabling auto-steering, lane changing, and parking features. Tesla’s deployment strategy and messaging were criticized following a series of crashes and its first Autopilot-driven fatality in the summer of 2016, although the NHTSA’s official report was favorable towards Autopilot and did not find a safety defect.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Since the accident, Tesla and Mobileye severed ties, with the California automaker seeking to consolidate control over the development of its radar- and camera-based system (eschewing costly lidar sensors). According to former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, Tesla has also rebuffed a partnership with Uber to collaborate on self-driving vehicles.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Starting in October 2016, all Tesla vehicles were built with Autopilot Hardware 2, a sensor and computing package the company said would enable “full self-driving” capabilities once its software matured. The system traded Mobileye’s EyeQ3 for Nvidia’s Drive PX2 platform and required an activation fee to unlock the full autonomy promised. Users reported poor performance during the initial rollout of Autopilot 2.0 software, although the system has improved with subsequent updates.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In March 2018, a man died when his Tesla ran into a highway barrier in California. After federal investigators learned the individual, Walter Huang, had previously complained about his Tesla’s Autopilot feature malfunctioning, they opened an investigation into Tesla’s self-driving technology. After Tesla made data from the car public in its defense, the US National Transportation Safety Board stripped Tesla of its role in the investigation into the crash, launching a feud and setting back expectations for Tesla’s self-driving car project.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In August 2018, Elon Musk announced the upcoming release of Autopilot Hardware 3. Model X and Model S vehicles equipped with Autopilot Hardware 3 went into production in March 2019. The system features custom chips manufactured by Tesla, replacing the Nvidia Drive platform.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Tesla offers two tiers of self-driving capability in its vehicles: Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. Full Self-Driving (FSD) costs an additional $10,000 and includes features like Summon and Navigate on Autopilot, which enables lane changes and interchanges. In October 2020, Tesla launched the Full Self-Driving beta, an update that initially went to a small group of customers. A full release is expected in the months ahead. Ford, Uber, Waymo, and other members of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, an industry coalition, have criticized Musk’s messaging. They argue that Tesla’s vehicles aren’t truly autonomous because an active driver must always be ready to take over.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Despite the title, Tesla’s vehicles are only designated autonomy Level 2 by SAE, meaning they are capable of some autonomous maneuvers but are not considered fully autonomous. Development is currently underway on a next-generation chip that Musk claims will be “3 times better” than the current chip.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
Musk also claimed in April 2019 that the US electric vehicle maker will be able to launch fully autonomous robotaxis by the end of 2020. But he acknowledged a year later that achieving this goal in a proposed timeframe isn’t going to happen.,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars

The Japan-based automaker announced at CES 2020 an ambitious plan to build a city to test its self-driving and smart technology as well as robot-assisted living.,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"According to Toyota’s CEO Akio Toyoda,",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"“With people, buildings, and vehicles all connected and communicating with each other through data and sensors, we will be able to test AI technology, in both the virtual and the physical world, maximizing its potential.”",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The city is expected to house about 2,000 people, and will be located in the foothills of Mount Fuji. Work to start building the city is expected to start in 2021.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Toyota’s self-driving tech ambitions began in 2015, when it announced a $1B budget for autonomous driving research, establishing its advanced Toyota Research Institute (TRI) headed by Gill Pratt. Toyota has also hired professors and researchers from Stanford University, MIT, and the entire staff of the autonomous vehicle company Jaybridge Robotics. In April 2017, it also announced its third US university partnership with an automotive engineering stalwart, the University of Michigan.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In January 2018, Toyota revealed the latest iteration of its flagship autonomous vehicle. A few months later, it announced an investment of $2.8B in a new spin-off company, the Toyota Research Institute – Advanced Development (TRI-AD), designed to accelerate the company’s progress toward its self-imposed deadline for achieving testing of autonomous, electric cars.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"TRI CEO Gill Pratt has been a vocal proponent of a “guardian angel” system, where the vehicle would monitor a driver’s inputs and intervene only when a human is about to make a dangerous mistake. TRI is also researching a second system (dubbed Chauffeur) targeted toward traditional Level 4 and 5 autonomy. The Chauffeur system would be primarily targeted at elderly people and people with disabilities.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"TRI-AD has achieved several other successes as well. Together with Maxar, the institute managed to turn satellite photos into autonomous car maps. Although in a proof-of-concept stage, this breakthrough could make road-mapping faster and cheaper. Companies currently carry out mapping using a fleet of vehicles that are expensive and have to be redeployed each time roads are built or changed. Toyota is also working with Carmera, an HD maps and road intelligence startup, on researching whether dashcam recordings could be used to map roads.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"As of January 2021, TRI-AD is to become a holding company called Woven Planet Holdings.

"Self-driving cars initially had a big role to play in Uber‘s goal of becoming the “one-stop shop for the movement of people and powering local commerce around the world.” Its $7.3B self-driving unit, Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), accounted for a significant chunk of Uber’s valuation in April 2019.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"ATG was spending $20M per month as of 2016, according to court documents that were unsealed in the lead-up to the company’s IPO in 2019. A major reason for why Uber was focused on self-driving is that it would help curb a major cost to the company: human drivers. Drivers account for nearly 80% of the company’s cost per mile for a ride, according to data by Frost & Sullivan.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The documents also reveal just how quickly Uber expected self-driving adoption to accelerate: it planned to have 75,000 autonomous vehicles in operation by 2019 and to have driverless taxi services operating in 13 cities by 2022.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The company fell short of that first milestone: in April 2019, it had just 250 autonomous cars on the road.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
Uber has had a tumultuous relationship with autonomous vehicle development.,Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick was a noted champion of his ride-sharing company embracing autonomous cars, with the technology representing both an existential threat and an opportunity for the startup to validate its stratospheric valuation. In 2016, he said, “What would happen if…we weren’t part of the autonomy thing? Then the future passes us by basically, in a very expeditious and efficient way.”",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"The company has made several moves in that direction, such as poaching nearly the entire Carnegie Mellon Robotics Lab (40 engineers) to work on the project in Pittsburgh. Uber also partnered with the University of Arizona to develop better mapping and optical safety technology.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In May 2016, Uber revealed its in-house autonomous prototypes for the first time, and the company acquired self-driving truck startup Otto later in the year. The acquisition embroiled Uber in legal controversy, with Waymo alleging that employees stole confidential files relating to its proprietary lidar sensors.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"That lawsuit settled, as Uber agreed to give Alphabet $245M in equity. The company has also faced waves of negative press on sexual harassment and poor culture, in addition to deceiving authorities and ignoring autonomous testing regulations. The company has suffered from an exodus of both engineering and non-engineering talent. And the company has had numerous troubles with its self-driving cars and safety.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Just hours after Uber began self-driving trials in San Francisco, reports surfaced of a close call with a human-driven car. Subsequent reports alleged that Uber vehicles were self-driving into bike lanes throughout San Francisco without warning. Finally, in March 2018, a self-driving Uber vehicle was involved in a fatal crash in Arizona, striking and killing 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg. Uber was subsequently banned from testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in Arizona.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In the aftermath of the crash and the ensuing investigation, Uber suspended all of its self-driving car trials and pulled all its autonomous vehicles off the road. Around the same time, Uber announced the end of its self-driving truck program, Otto. However, in August 2018, Uber announced a $500M investment from Toyota and a plan to jointly work on autonomous vehicle development.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"In June 2019, Uber unveiled a new self-driving car model, this time developed in partnership with Volvo. The model features more safety features and redundancy than the previous self-driving models Uber has developed — but it is also being designed to operate without a human driver behind the wheel. Uber completed limited testing in March 2020 on the streets of San Francisco.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"Uber secured new capital for the venture as well. In April 2019, it was announced that the company had raised $1B in investments to fuel its autonomous driving efforts: $333M from the SoftBank Vision Fund and $667M from Toyota Motor Corp and Denso Corp. In a move toward reviving the testing of its autonomous vehicles, Uber also received licenses in February 2020 to resume its self-driving trials in California and to launch trials in Washington DC and Dallas.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
"However, amid growing losses and wider profitability concerns, Uber sold ATG to autonomous vehicle startup Aurora Innovation in December 2020. The deal, which includes Uber transferring its ATG equity to Aurora and a $400M investment in the combined company, marks an end to Uber’s pursuit of self-driving cars. Uber will reportedly maintain a 26% stake in the combined company, and as part of the deal, Aurora’s autonomous vehicles will one day be deployed on Uber’s ride-hailing platform.",Companies Working on Autonomous Cars
