       "[<p>The term ‘autopilot’ has been used for decades within the aircraft industry, enabling pilots to reduce their cognitive load by allowing an aircraft to practically fly itself during “cruising” portions of the trip. The same is now happening as cars with autopilot are rapidly turning into more autonomous, self-driving vehicles, allowing drivers to let the cars drive themselves on certain portions of the trip, like freeways.<br/></p>,\n",
       " <p>Tesla most famously branded its self-driving features as “Autopilot”, but many other automakers are now including similar self-driving and autonomous vehicle features as part of their driving assistance option packages. <br/></p>,\n",
       " <p>This article provides a breakdown of cars with autopilot and who offers what, but first, we’ll go through a bit of background and explanation of terms.</p>,\n",
       " <p>First, let’s define exactly what constitutes ‘autopilot’-like features. Autonomous systems in cars and self-driving vehicles can take many different forms, from basic driver assistance features, like cruise control, to semi-autonomous, all the way to full self-driving capabilities. The industry even has a set of levels to help classify this automation.<br/></p>,\n",
       " <p>Learn more about this by reading our article on <a aria-label=\"SAE self driving levels (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/self-driving-cars-sae-levels/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>SAE self-driving levels</strong></a> for cars and autonomous vehicles.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Autopilot is a generic term used in multiple industries, particularly aircraft, and generally means that something can guide itself without human intervention.  In relation to cars in 2021, most mainstream carmakers are focused on, <strong><a aria-label=\"Level 2 autonomy (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/self-driving-cars-sae-levels/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Level 2 autonomy</a></strong>. This level allows the vehicle to take over most steering, acceleration <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" data-gr-id=\"4\" id=\"4\">and</g> braking functions, but still requires that the driver remain fully attentive to the driving situation and be able to intervene at any moment. It is not driverless, fully autonomous driving, like robotaxis from Waymo or Cruise (that are now testing in California).</p>,\n",
       " <p>That means, today, autopilot really means ‘assisted driving’ and not ‘self-driving’ since the driver still has to be alert and attentive at all times.  It won’t be until Level 4 or Level 5 fully autonomous cars hit the roads that the true promise of full self-driving will be a reality. Currently, that’s not expected to happen until 2022 (although the team at Tesla is pushing hard to do so as soon as possible, as announced at <a aria-label=\"Tesla Autonomy Day (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/tesla-autonomy-investor-day-full-self-driving-advancements/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla Autonomy Day</a>, since all new cars sold with <a aria-label=\"Hardware 3 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/tesla-custom-ai-chips-hardware-3/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hardware 3</a> are much more powerful).</p>,\n",
       " <p>Learn more about <a aria-label=\"autonomous Full Self-Driving capabilities (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/tesla-autonomous-full-self-driving/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">autonomous Full Self-Driving capabilities</a> that Tesla currently includes today.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Core AutoPilot Features</strong><br/></p>,\n",
       " <p>At minimum, we define autopilot (Level 2) to include the following features for use on freeways and highways with “controlled access” (i.e., they have on-ramps and off-ramps and no-cross traffic intersections):<br/></p>,\n",
       " <p>Other autopilot features that are useful, but not critical for the ‘autopilot’ designation, are:</p>,\n",
       " <p>Presently only Tesla is able to achieve the additional three mentioned above with their Full Self-Driving and Enhanced Autopilot options on <a aria-label=\"‘Hardware 2’ (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/tesla-autopilot-v1-v2-v3-and-beyond-differences/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">‘Hardware 2’</a> vehicles.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Isn’t This Just Automated Cruise Control with Lane Centering?</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>If you step back and look at the core of what’s being provided, we’re really talking about automated cruise control with the ability to steer itself (keep the vehicle centered in the lane).  However, the second part (steering) is critical and one of the most difficult tasks, which we’ll explain below.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Lane Keeping Assist vs Automated Lane Centering (steering)</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>One of the most confusing aspects of choosing a good autopilot system is understanding the difference between what’s often called “Lane Keeping Assist” (LKA) and automated steering where the system is actually keeping the car centered at all times with no driver input (other than hands on the wheel, if the system requires it). </p>,\n",
       " <p>Almost all major car companies have some sort of LKA functionality, however, that usually means helping to move the vehicle back to the center of the lane if it drifts.  Some systems are robust enough where you could keep your hands off the wheel for a short period of time so it feels like automated steering to a certain degree.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In reality, the future systems will be ones that can accurately identify the road and combine that with map data to ensure the car can steer itself on the road as good or better than a human driver.  So far, only Tesla and GM’s Super Cruise are able to do that, but only in certain conditions (e.g. the road only has mild curves).</p>,\n",
       " <p>The bottom line is, if you see “Lane Keeping Assist”, be sure to dig into that feature and test drive it on the freeway to understand whether it automatically keeps the system centered in the lane automatically, and how well it does it.  The last thing you want is a false sense of security and have the car drift into another lane or off the road.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>What About Basic Safety Features?</strong><br/></p>,\n",
       " <p>Most all cars that have autopilot-like features, also have fairly common automated safety systems included, called Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) within the industry. These core safety features include:<br/></p>,\n",
       " <p>All these features are “must-have” today and you should double check to ensure they are included with your vehicle and package options.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Historically, most auto-manufacturers have relied on Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), like Mobileye, Delphi and Bosch, etc. to provide autopilot parts and technologies for their cars, including things like navigation systems.  This allows the auto manufacturers to concentrate on developing and marketing the core cars themselves while other companies focus on specialized parts and technology.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Mobileye, which was purchased by Intel, is arguably the leading OEM in providing autopilot technology, via their EyeQ line of visual perception chips, to auto manufacturers. They famously provided Autopilot technology for the first-generation Tesla Model S vehicles that came with Enhanced Autopilot. Later, Tesla began to develop its own technology as Elon Musk wanted to push autonomous driving technology faster.  Mobileye previously focused on perception technology (i.e. identifying objects) with its EyeQ chips and it was up to the manufacturers to integrate driving control hardware and software but now Mobileye is also beginning to offer “full-stack” autopilot solutions.  Today Mobileye is providing autopilot-like technology to manufacturers such as Audi, BMW and Nissan via their EyeQ 4 and EyeQ 5 chipsets.  </p>,\n",
       " <p>NVIDIA is close behind Mobileye in developing autopilot features.  In fact, their latest ADAS system is termed “Autopilot” (<a aria-label=\"see this article (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/nvidia-announces-drive-autopilot/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">see this article</a>).  NVIDIA comes from a gaming / AI chipset development background and rightfully believes that more powerful AI-like system will be required in cars to achieve reliable full-self driving.  They are supplying solutions to Volvo and Mercedes for their future vehicles.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Other startups and companies, like Cruise (GM), Aurora, Argo and Zoox (now Amazon) are also gaining momentum, but are primarily focused on robo-taxis and are in testing phases rather than large-scale rollouts.</p>,\n",
       " <p>That said, many car manufacturers are developing their own technology as they feel it’s critical as a future differentiator. Tesla is most famous in this regard, having created a sophisticated Autopilot system using a neural network based on cameras.  Toyota, Honda and Subaru have also created their own systems.  </p>,\n",
       " <p>Why does it matter? Generally speaking, dedicated OEMs like Mobileye can innovate faster than auto manufacturers. However, some auto manufacturers like Tesla are <a aria-label=\"innovating so quickly (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/tesla-autonomy-investor-day-full-self-driving-advancements/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">innovating so quickly</a> that they push over-the-air software updates to their cars, just like your smartphone. Most traditional auto manufacturers don’t update software, requiring you to purchase a new model year instead.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Regardless, all manufacturers are beholden to regulatory approval before bringing new autonomous driving technology to the market. </p>,\n",
       " <p>For those automotive enthusiasts and tech-savvy tinkerers who want cutting-edge autopilot features, there is another solution from <a aria-label=\"comma.ai (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/comma-ai-openpilot-diy-autopilot-kit/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">comma.ai</a> using the open-source openpilot software.  This taps into newer-model vehicles with autopilot, like the ones below, but supercharges them with advanced machine learning and neural network capabilities.</p>,\n",

       " <p>Most auto manufacturers claim to have some sort of self-driving capability, whether it’s basic Adaptive Cruise Control or Lane Keeping Assist, or a combination of both.  However, simply having those features doesn’t mean they work well. </p>,\n",
       " <p>These are generally the most important criteria for autopilot functionality:</p>,\n",
       " <p>While we have not personally tested each system, the criteria above are what we watch out for in reviews and videos to understand how well each autopilot system performs.</p>,\n",
       " <p>While there are many ‘autopilot’-like systems available from car manufacturers today, they are generally a combination of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA). As mentioned previously LKA by itself only nudges a car back to the center of the lane, but does not keep it centered.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The cars below are ones that are generally considered the top cars with autopilot and do a good job automatically keeping a car centered in the lane.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Top Cars with AutoPilot features for 2021:</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>We go into more detail on each one below, so read on.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Overview:</em><br/>Tesla has long been a leader in terms of autopilot functionality in cars, even calling their system ‘Autopilot’. Not only is their system one of the most sophisticated and accurate on the road, but it’s also <a href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/full-self-driving-update/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">continually updated over-the-air</a> (just like your smartphone), so the vehicles just keep getting better and better. The biggest downside is that driver monitoring only uses steering wheel inputs to determine whether the driver is paying attention vs facial monitoring, for example.</p>,\n",

       " <p><em>Supported Models: <br/></em>All current Tesla vehicles (the Tesla Model S, Model X and Model 3) all support Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features as an option, AP2 and above.  Older Tesla models (pre-2016) with AP1 have an older version of Autopilot that doesn’t have all the current features.<br/></p>,\n",

Tesla continually updates Autopilot with <a href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/full-self-driving-update/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">powerful features rolling out</a> all the time. However it’s so powerful it can be used almost anywhere, meaning it’s up to the driver to pay attention and use it properly as driver monitoring is only via the steering wheel.</p>,\n",

       " <p><em>Core Features:</em></p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Verdict:<br/></em>The Super Cruise system at or right behind Tesla Autopilot in our opinion.  While Tesla Autopilot is more powerful and sophisticated, the Super Cruise system is better suited to everyday drivers since it restricts use to freeways it has mapped in the US (most major ones) and strictly monitors driver attentiveness using eye-tracking, therefore limiting mistakes that can be made by drivers, particularly older drivers (Cadillac’s primary demographic).  The driver monitoring system is one of the reasons why Consumer Reports gives it the highest rating, even about Tesla’s Autopilot system. </p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Overview:<br/></em>The Volkswagen Group is the parent company of several brands, including VW, Audi, and Porsche. Audi has recently made aggressive moves into self-driving, including touting a Level 3 system in Europe which is unfortunately not yet in the US due to regulatory concerns.

There’s also a system called “Adaptive Drive Assist” for foreign markets.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Technology Used:</em><br/>Audi has recently made aggressive moves into self-driving, including the first Lidar unit in a consumer vehicle, the A8 (and now the A6 and Q8), in addition to its new zFAS controller that integrates sensor inputs into a single computing unit.

       " <p><em>Overview:</em><br/>BMW has long had adaptive cruise control with rudimentary lane center, but with certain 2019 models, they are rolling out new technology. The system is not updated over the air and must be taken into the dealer for updates.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>What It’s Called:</em><br/><strong>Driving Assistant Pro</strong> with Extended Traffic Jam Assistant</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Technology Used:<br/></em>BMW utilizes the Mobileye EyeQ platform in the Driving Assistant package with control software from ZF, and on the newest models, the EyeQ 4 chip with a tri-focal camera set looking forward. It also has forward and rear radar sensors.  With some options, it also includes an eye monitoring camera.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Supported Models: </em><br/>Available on select models, including BMW X5 7 and 3 series.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Core Features:</em></p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Verdict:<br/></em>The BMW system is loaded with features but its lane centering (crucial for autopilot), leaves something to be desired and isn’t nearly as robust as Tesla’s during our tests.  That said, at low speeds (under 40mph) in freeway traffic, the hands-free option (using eye-monitoring) is a nice option.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Overview:<br/></em>Ford offers basic driver assistance with many of its current vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, called Co-Pilot 360, which includes basic stop-and-go Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with basic Automatic Lane Centering (ALC) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA).  However, where things really get interesting will be with the upcoming Ford Co-Pilot 360 2.0, now called “BlueCruise” coming later in 2021 on the <a href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/ford-mach-e-vs-model-y-tesla/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Mach-E</a> and the 2021 Ford F-150.

       " <p><em>Core Features:</em></p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Verdict:<br/></em>Overall the Ford / Lincoln Co-Pilot 360 system as it stands today is a very capable Autopilot system. While the Lane Centering won’t handle sharp turns, it does a great job on primarily straight roads with gentle curves.  This system will definitely help with long commutes and freeway driving.  The next version, Co-Pilot 360 2.0 / “BlueCruise”, coming with the <a href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/ford-mach-e-vs-model-y-tesla/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mach-E</a> and Ford F-150 later in 2021 should be one to watch.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Overview:<br/></em>The Hyundai Motor Group and Kia Motors are jointly owned entities that produce distinct but similar vehicles using common platforms and parts. In 2019 Hyundai invested in self-driving startup Aurora, but that technology has not made it to public release yet.  Currently, Kia and Hyundai offer Level 2 technology in some of their 2020 vehicles that is best-in-class outside of advanced systems like Tesla and GM Supercruise.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>What It’s Called:<br/></em><strong>Lane Following Assist</strong> (LFA) and  <strong>Smart Cruise Control w/ Stop and Go</strong> (SCC)<br/><strong>Highway Drive Assist</strong> (HDA) combines LFA and SCC, plus automatically adjust to speed limits</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Technology Used:<br/></em>Currently Hyundai / Kia used an in-house technology called HDA2 (Highway Driving Assist), but may in the future leverage technology from the Aurora investment.  They also have worked with Intel / Mobileye in the past as well and likely use their EyeQ sensors.</p>,\n",
       " <p><em>Supported Models:<br/></em>Hyundai Palisade, Sonata, Kia Telluride, plus others.</p>,\n",

       " <p>Toyota has the <strong>Toyota Safety Sense (TSS)</strong> system, the latest version being TSS 2.0.  Lexus calls its system the Lexus Safety System (LSS) and the automation Lexus CODRIVE.  TSS 2.0 initially became available in the 2020 RAV4 and 2020 Corolla and has since rolled out to more vehicles.  Both Lexus and Toyota use a feature called “Lane Tracing Assist” which allows the vehicle to center itself in a lane, but is not as robust as Tesla, Cadillac or BMW.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Honda has the <strong>Honda Sensing Suite</strong> that includes ACC and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS). With Acura it’s called AcuraWatch and also comes with LKAS.

       " <p>Subaru has offered their Eyesight technology for quite some time that provides ACC and basic LKA.  It uses two cameras above the windshield for stereoscopic vision.  While this does a decent job, it isn’t as robust as other systems that use a combination of cameras and radar.</p>,\n",
       " <p>While not an auto manufacturer, Comma.ai has released a <strong><a aria-label=\"DIY autopilot kit based on the openpilot (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.autopilotreview.com/comma-ai-openpilot-diy-autopilot-kit/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DIY autopilot kit based on the openpilot</a></strong>, called Comma Two.  It only works on certain, modern cars but is an interesting alternative for those tech-savvy car enthusiasts who want to hack their cars. Additionally, it won high praise from Consumer Reports in terms of overall capabilities and functions. </p>,\n",
       " <p>Autopilot-like functions are becoming more and more mainstream as technology improves. By 2022, most car manufacturers will be offering some sort of more advanced self-driving capabilities.</p>,\n",
       " <p>However, for now, if you want the most powerful AutoPilot-like functionality, <strong>we’d opt for a Tesla or GM vehicle with Super Cruise</strong>.  That said, <strong>Ford</strong> has a great system with BlueCruise, <strong>Hyundai / Kia</strong> has a solid offering on their latest vehicles, <strong>Audi </strong>is coming on strong and <strong>BMW, Nissan/Infiniti</strong>, and others will continue to expand their Mobileye offerings over the next few years. All other systems are still fairly immature and require heavy attentiveness, but will be improving quickly in early 2021.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>What’s Important to Know When Evaluating</strong></p>,\n",
       " <p>When evaluating autopilot-like self driving systems, the main thing to look out for is Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and whether it handles starting and stopping at all speeds and on what kinds of roads.  Then learn how well the vehicle can identify roads and stay in the center of the lane, called Lane Centering.  Most manufacturers tout “Lane Keeping Assist” (LKA) as a way to help automate steering, but that’s different from Lane Centering and often a far cry from something like Tesla’s Autopilot system or Cadillac’s Super Cruise that are able to stay steadily centered in the lanes while driving.</p>,\n",
       " <p>If you’re not sure, check out videos on YouTube – enthusiasts and professionals often test out the systems to provide their opinions and real-world examples.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Also, ask the dealer how the system can be updated since technology and software changes so quickly.  In Tesla’s case, the Autopilot system is continually updated over-the-air with software updates.  Most other auto manufacturers require the updates to occur at the dealer during regular service updates.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Either way, the good news is that more and more cars will have autopilot features and help cars become much safer in the years to come.</p>,\n",
