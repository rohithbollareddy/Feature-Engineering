       "'Mobileye, which was purchased by Intel, is arguably the leading OEM in providing autopilot technology, via their EyeQ line of visual perception chips, to auto manufacturers. They famously provided Autopilot technology for the first-generation Tesla Model S vehicles that came with Enhanced Autopilot. Later, Tesla began to develop its own technology as Elon Musk wanted to push autonomous driving technology faster. \\xa0Mobileye previously focused on perception technology (i.e. identifying objects) with its EyeQ chips and it was up to the manufacturers to integrate driving control hardware and software but now Mobileye is also beginning to offer “full-stack” autopilot solutions.  Today Mobileye is providing autopilot-like technology to manufacturers such as Audi, BMW and Nissan via their EyeQ 4 and EyeQ 5 chipsets.  '"
